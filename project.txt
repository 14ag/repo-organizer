requirements:
--{project_count}: number of times (^##\s) occurs for setting loop limits
{project_readme}: the readme for the specific branch
{branch-name}: name of the repo found using (^##\s)
{project_file}: excercise .py file
{print}: bool variable that allows to write to {project_readme}




todo list: 

inside the bat:
    create github branch called {{project number}hyphen{branch-name: with spaces replaces with hyphen}}
    checkout to branch 
    copy {corresponding file} and {individual readme}
    git commit push


inside python:
    use pattern to find py file associated with the readme
        >implement getFileName()



testing:
add batch calls to helper function
    =>dry run to see if :
        all vars are defined
        all files are found
        


notes
--use batch script only as a launcher
--use the readme to iterate:
++send the read lines from main to helper to check regex






done:
inside python:
    receive args
    preform regex and categorise if start or end of new {project_readme}
    return vars using os.sys(f'echo {variables}')
        >True :start sending output to new {project_readme}
        >False  :discard till next start
        >{branch-name}
